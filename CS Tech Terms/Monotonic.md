### **Monotonic (Definition)**

A sequence (or array) is **monotonic** if it **only moves in one direction** — it **never decreases** or **never increases**.

### **Types of Monotonic Sequences**

1. **Monotonically increasing**
    
    - Each element is **greater than or equal to** the previous one.
        
    - Example: `[1, 2, 2, 5, 6]`
        
2. **Strictly increasing**
    
    - Each element is **strictly greater** than the previous one.
        
    - Example: `[1, 2, 3, 4]`
        
3. **Monotonically decreasing**
    
    - Each element is **less than or equal to** the previous one.
        
    - Example: `[6, 4, 4, 2, 1]`
        
4. **Strictly decreasing**
    
    - Each element is **strictly less** than the previous one.
        
    - Example: `[5, 4, 3, 2]`

### **Monotonic in Algorithms**

- **Monotonic stack/queue**: Data structure where elements are **always in monotonic order**.
    
    - Useful for problems like **Next Greater Element**, **Sliding Window Maximum**.

### **Quick Note**

- “Monotone” and “monotonic” are **used interchangeably** in coding/algorithm problems.
