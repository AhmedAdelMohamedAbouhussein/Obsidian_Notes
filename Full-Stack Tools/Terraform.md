**Terraform** is an **open-source Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tool** developed by **HashiCorp** that lets you **define and provision infrastructure** using a **declarative configuration language** called **HCL** (HashiCorp Configuration Language).

Terraform helps you:

- **Automate** infrastructure setup
- **Version control** infrastructure changes (like Git for servers/networks)
- Create consistent environments (Dev, Staging, Production)
- **Avoid manual errors** in setting up cloud or on-prem resources

Terraform talks to **cloud APIs** (like AWS, Azure, GCP, etc.) and provisions the infrastructure for you.
