**Express.js** is a **minimal and flexible web application framework for Node.js**. It's used to build **server-side applications and RESTful APIs** quickly and efficiently.

### What Express.js Does:
- Simplifies handling **HTTP requests and responses**.
- Helps define **routes** (URLs) for your app (e.g., GET `/users`, POST `/login`).
- Supports **middleware**, which allows you to add functionality (like logging, authentication, error handling).
- Works well with **template engines**, **databases**, and **frontend frameworks** (like React or Angular).
