A **REST API** (Representational State Transfer Application Programming Interface) is a way for different software systems to communicate with each other over the internet using **HTTP requests**.

A REST API lets one application (like your frontend) **talk to** another (like your backend or a server) to **get**, **send**, **update**, or **delete** data.

### ðŸ”‘ REST API Characteristics:

1. **Stateless** â€“ Every request is independent; server doesnâ€™t remember past requests.
2. **Resource-Based** â€“ Each piece of data (user, post, product) is treated as a "resource" with a URL.
3. **Uses HTTP Methods** â€“ As shown above.
4. **Usually returns JSON** â€“ A lightweight format for sending data.
