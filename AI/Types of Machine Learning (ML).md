## 1. Supervised Learning

**Meaning:**

- Model learns from **labeled data** (input → known output).
    
- Goal: **predict output** for new data.
    

**Examples:**

- **Classification:** Spam detection, tumor detection (yes/no)
    
- **Regression:** Predict house prices, stock prices
    

**Memory Hook:** **“Teacher gives the answers, model learns from them”**

**One-Line Exam Answer:**

> Supervised learning trains a model on labeled data to predict outputs for new inputs.

## 2. Unsupervised Learning

**Meaning:**

- Model learns from **unlabeled data** (only input, no known output).
    
- Goal: **find patterns or structure** in data.
    

**Examples:**

- **Clustering:** Customer segmentation, grouping similar images
    
- **Dimensionality Reduction:** PCA (reduces features while keeping variance)
    

**Memory Hook:** **“No teacher, find patterns yourself”**

**One-Line Exam Answer:**

> Unsupervised learning identifies patterns or structures in unlabeled data.

## 3. Reinforcement Learning

**Meaning:**

- Model learns by **trial and error**, receiving **rewards or penalties** for actions.
    
- Goal: **learn optimal strategy (policy)** over time.
    

**Examples:**

- Game AI (Chess, Go)
    
- Self-driving cars
    
- Robotics
    

**Memory Hook:** **“Learn by getting rewards or punishments”**

**One-Line Exam Answer:**

> Reinforcement learning trains an agent to take actions in an environment to maximize cumulative rewards.

## 4. Other Advanced Types

|Type|Description|Example|
|---|---|---|
|Semi-supervised|Uses **small labeled + large unlabeled** dataset|Image recognition with few labeled samples|
|Self-supervised|Learns **representations from the data itself**|GPT language models, BERT|
|Online / Incremental Learning|Learns **continuously as new data arrives**|Real-time stock prediction|
