In the context of **Express** (and most web frameworks), **controllers** are just JavaScript functions whose job is to handle the logic for a specific route.

Think of them as the “middle managers” of your backend:

- **Routes** decide _which_ controller to call.
- **Controllers** decide _what to do_ with the request — fetch data, process it, call APIs, etc.
- **Models/Services** (if you have them) actually talk to the database or external services.\

Without Controllers (all-in-one rout) This works, but the logic lives right in your route definition.

With Controllers (cleaner separation)


✅ **Benefits of using controllers**

- Keeps your routes file clean and readable.
- Makes your logic reusable (same controller can be used in multiple places).
- Easier to test (you can test controllers independently of the routes).
- Follows **MVC** (Model–View–Controller) pattern for better project structure.



- **Routes**: the _address book_ — they connect URLs to logic.
- **Controllers**: the _workers_ — they contain the actual logic that runs.
