Mongoose is a **Node.js library** that makes working with MongoDB easier.

### **What Mongoose Does**
- Acts as an **Object Data Modeling (ODM)** tool for MongoDB.
- Lets you define a **schema** for your documents (even though MongoDB is schema-less).
- Handles **validation**, **type casting**, and **query building**.
- Provides helper methods for CRUD operations.

**Why people like Mongoose:**
- Gives structure to your MongoDB data.
- Adds built-in validations.
- Cleaner, shorter syntax for most operations.
    
⚠ **Downside:**
- Slightly more overhead than using the native MongoDB driver.


## **When to Use Mongoose**

You’ll benefit from Mongoose if:

1. **You want a schema**
    - Your data has a consistent structure (e.g., users always have `name`, `email`, `password`).
    - You want built-in **validation** (e.g., email format check).
    
2. **You want models & clean code**
    - You prefer working with models like in SQL ORMs.

3. **You want middleware/hooks**
	- For example, automatically hashing a password before saving:
	
4. **You’re building a large, team-based project**
    - Enforcing a schema reduces “data chaos” when multiple developers insert data.

## **When to Use Native MongoDB Driver**

The native driver is better if:
1. **You need maximum speed & control**
    - Less abstraction = faster performance.
        
2. **Your data is flexible / schema-less**
    - E.g., logging service where each log entry might have different fields.
        
3. **You’re doing complex aggregation pipelines**
    - The native driver works directly with MongoDB’s raw commands.
        
4. **You want minimal dependencies**
    - No extra libraries, just:
