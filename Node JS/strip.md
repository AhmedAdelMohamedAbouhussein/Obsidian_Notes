Stripe is a **payment processing platform** with an excellent **Node.js SDK** (`stripe` package) that makes it really easy to:

- Accept **credit/debit cards**, Apple Pay, Google Pay.
- Handle **subscriptions** and one-time charges.
- Store customer payment info securely (without touching card data directly).
- Get detailed payment analytics and fraud detection.

### **Installing Stripe in Node.js**
`npm install stripe`

### **How it works**

1. **Frontend** (React, for example) sends the payment amount to `/create-payment-intent`.
2. **Backend** calls Stripe’s API to create a **PaymentIntent**.
3. Stripe returns a `client_secret` that the frontend uses to complete payment securely.
4. You **never handle card details directly** — Stripe does it for you.
