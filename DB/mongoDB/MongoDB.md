**MongoDB** is a popular **NoSQL database** designed for storing data in a flexible, JSON-like format called BSON (Binary JSON).

---

### Key features of MongoDB:

- **Document-oriented:** Instead of tables and rows, MongoDB stores data as **documents** in collections. Each document is like a JSON object with fields and values.
- **Schema-flexible:** Documents in the same collection don’t need to have the same structure — you can easily add or change fields without migrations.
- **Scalable:** Designed to scale horizontally across many servers with built-in sharding and replication.
- **Powerful querying:** Supports rich queries, indexing, aggregation pipelines, and full-text search.
- **Good for:** Apps with evolving data models, big data, real-time analytics, content management, and more.
