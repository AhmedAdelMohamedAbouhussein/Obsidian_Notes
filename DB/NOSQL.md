**NoSQL** stands for "**Not Only SQL**" or sometimes "**Non-relational**" databases. It’s a broad category of databases designed to store and manage data in ways different from traditional relational (SQL) databases.
### What is NoSQL?

- **Non-relational:** Unlike SQL databases that use tables with fixed schemas and structured query language (SQL), NoSQL databases store data in flexible formats such as key-value pairs, documents, graphs, or wide-column stores.
- **Schema-less or flexible schema:** NoSQL databases don’t require a predefined schema, making it easier to handle unstructured or evolving data.
- **Designed for scalability:** Many NoSQL databases are built to scale horizontally across many servers, handling big volumes of data and high traffic.

### When to use NoSQL?

- When your data is **unstructured or semi-structured** (e.g., JSON).
- When you need **flexible or evolving schemas**.
- For **big data** or **real-time web apps** requiring fast read/write speeds and horizontal scaling.
- When you want to store **hierarchical or graph data** efficiently.
