## ðŸ”¹ What is `URL.createObjectURL`?

`URL.createObjectURL()` is a **JavaScript method** that creates a **temporary local URL** that points to a `Blob` (binary large object) or `File` object stored in the browserâ€™s memory.

This URL looks something like:

`blob:http://localhost:3000/f4b2e9e1-b6f3-45a0-8a5a-7e83e71234ab`

## ðŸ”¹ Why is it useful?

When a user uploads a file with `<input type="file" />`, you **donâ€™t have direct access to the file path** (for security reasons).  
But you still want to **preview** the image (or video, PDF, etc.) before uploading it.

Thatâ€™s where `URL.createObjectURL` comes in:

- It creates a local **preview link** for the file.
    
- You can use that link in an `<img src="...">` tag (or `<video>`, `<audio>`, etc.)

## ðŸ”¹ Important notes

1. **Temporary only** â†’ The URL only exists while the page is open.
    
    - If you refresh, itâ€™s gone.
        
    - Itâ€™s not a real web link others can access.
        
2. **Free up memory** â†’ Each created object takes memory.
    
    - Use `URL.revokeObjectURL(url)` when you no longer need it.

3. **Not a replacement for hosting** â†’ If you want a permanent image link (like for a user profile), you must upload the file to storage (Cloudflare R2, Firebase, S3, etc.) and save the returned **public URL**.

âš¡So in your case:

- `URL.createObjectURL(file)` is only for **previewing the profile pic while cropping**.
    
- After cropping, you should **upload** it to a server or cloud storage to get a permanent URL.
