`express.Router()` is a built-in method in Express.js that allows you to create modular, mountable route handlers. It helps organize your routes better, especially for large applications.
### Why use `express.Router()`?

It lets you:

- Group related routes together (e.g., all `/users` routes)
- Keep code clean and modular
- Avoid cluttering your main `app.js` or `server.js`
