**React OAuth2** refers to using the **OAuth 2.0 authentication protocol** within a **React.js application** to allow users to sign in via third-party providers (like Google, Facebook, GitHub, etc.) or your own authorization server.

### What is OAuth 2.0?

OAuth 2.0 is an **authorization framework** that lets applications access user data from another service **without exposing the userâ€™s password**.

Instead of logging in directly with credentials:

- The user logs into a trusted third-party (like Google).
- The third-party redirects back to your app with a **token**.
- The token is then used by your app to **authenticate** the user or access protected resources.
