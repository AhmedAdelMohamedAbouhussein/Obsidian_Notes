### 🔒 SSL (Secure Sockets Layer)

- A **cryptographic protocol** created in the 1990s.
    
- Purpose: **encrypt data** between two systems (like your browser ↔️ website).
    
- Prevents others from **reading or tampering** with the data.
    
- Example: when you see `https://`, it used to mean “SSL is protecting this site.”
    
- ⚠️ SSL itself is outdated and insecure now — nobody recommends using it anymore.

### 🔑 TLS (Transport Layer Security)

- The **newer, stronger version** of SSL.
    
- Think of TLS as “SSL 3.1+” — it replaced SSL in 1999.
    
- Provides:
    
    1. **Encryption** → keeps data private.
        
    2. **Authentication** → makes sure you’re talking to the real server, not a fake.
        
    3. **Integrity** → ensures data isn’t modified in transit.

### 📌 Example in Real Life

- When you log into a website like your bank:
    
    - Without SSL/TLS → hacker on Wi-Fi could see your password.
        
    - With TLS → your password is scrambled (encrypted), so hackers see only gibberish.

### ⚡ Difference in a nutshell

- **SSL** → Old, insecure, no longer recommended.
    
- **TLS** → Modern, secure, used everywhere today (when you see HTTPS, it’s actually **TLS**, even though people still say “SSL certificate”).
