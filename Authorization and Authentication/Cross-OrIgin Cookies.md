## ðŸ”‘ Why HTTPS is required for cross-origin cookies

### 1. `SameSite` rules

- Cookies control **when** the browser will send them.
- By default, modern browsers use `SameSite=Lax`.
    - That means: cookies are sent only if the request comes from the **same site**.
- If your frontend (`http://localhost:5173`) and backend (`http://localhost:5000`) are **different origins**, the cookie would normally be **blocked**.
- 
To allow cross-origin cookies, you must set:
`sameSite: "none"`

---

### 2. `Secure` rules

Browsers added another restriction:

- If a cookie has `SameSite=None`, then it **must also be `Secure: true`**.
- `Secure: true` means the cookie will **only be sent over HTTPS connections**.
- On plain `http://` â†’ the cookie wonâ€™t be stored or sent.

So you canâ€™t have:
`sameSite: "none", secure: false`

That combination is rejected by Chrome, Safari, and Firefox.

### 3. What happens if one side is HTTP

- **Backend HTTP, Frontend HTTPS:**  
    Backend canâ€™t set a secure cookie â†’ browser wonâ€™t save it.
- **Backend HTTPS, Frontend HTTP:**  
    Cookie requires `secure: true` â†’ browser wonâ€™t send it when frontend calls backend from HTTP.
- **Both HTTP:**  
    You can only use `sameSite: "lax"` or `strict`, but then **cookies wonâ€™t cross origins**.

ðŸ‘‰ Conclusion: For cross-origin cookies, **both frontend and backend must be HTTPS**.


- **For dev simplicity** â†’ Option 1 (proxy through Vite, keep HTTP, sameSite=Lax).
- **For production** â†’ Option 2 (HTTPS + secure cookies).
