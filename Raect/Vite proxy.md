## What is a Vite Proxy (in general)?

When you run a frontend app with **Vite** (like React, Vue, or Svelte), your frontend code is served from `http://localhost:5173` (by default).

If your app needs data from an API backend (say `http://localhost:8080`), your frontend JavaScript will try to fetch it. But browsers enforce **CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing)**, so calling `http://localhost:8080` directly from `http://localhost:5173` may cause **CORS errors** unless you configure the backend to allow it.

ðŸ‘‰ Vite provides a **proxy** option that tells the dev server:

> "If the frontend calls a certain path (like `/api`), donâ€™t actually serve it from the frontend. Instead, forward it to another server (like `http://localhost:8080`)."

This way:

- You call `fetch("/api/users")` from the frontend.
- Vite catches that request locally.
- It proxies (forwards) the request to `http://localhost:8080/api/users`.
- No CORS issue, because as far as the browser sees, the request is going to the same origin (`localhost:5173`).

## Example: Basic Vite Proxy Config

In your `vite.config.js`:

Now:
- Frontend calls â†’ `fetch("/api/login")`
- Vite forwards â†’ `http://localhost:8080/api/login`


f you **donâ€™t use proxy**, then frontend has to call `http://localhost:8080/api/...` directly â†’ triggers **CORS issues + cookie problems**.

If you **use Vite proxy**, then:

- Your frontend only ever calls `/api/...` (no different origin in the browser).
- Vite dev server transparently forwards those requests to your backend.
- Browser thinks everything comes from `http://localhost:5173` â†’ **no CORS issues, cookies work properly (since same-site)**.

---

âœ… **In dev:** use Vite proxy to avoid headaches.  
âœ… **In production (Vercel + Render):** no proxy; just make sure your backend sets proper CORS + cookies (`sameSite: "none"`, `secure: true`).
