    - A lightweight React component for cropping images/videos.

    - Provides a responsive, mobile-friendly UI for cropping.
        
- **Why we use it**:
    
    - Default `<input type="file" />` only lets you select images, but **not crop them**.
        
    - With `react-easy-crop`, the user can:  
        âœ… Zoom in / out  
        âœ… Move the image inside the crop area  
        âœ… Choose circular or rectangular cropping  
        âœ… Get the cropped image area coordinates
        
- **How to install**:

- **How to use (basic example)**:
-![[Pasted image 20250905191914.png]]
- **Output**:
    
    - Doesnâ€™t automatically save the cropped image.
    - Instead, it gives you the **crop coordinates** â†’ you then use a helper function (`getCroppedImg`) to generate the final cropped image (usually with `canvas`).

ðŸ‘‰ In short:  
`react-easy-crop` is the **go-to React library** for letting users upload & crop profile pictures with zoom and pan support.
