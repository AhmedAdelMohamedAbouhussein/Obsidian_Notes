- [ ] <span style="font-size:16px; color:green;">Tailwind CSS</span>:
	- is a utility-first framework that gives you small, reusable classes (like p-4 for padding or bg-blue-500 for color) to build custom designs directly in your HTML. Bootstrap, on the other hand, is component-based, offering ready-made UI elements (like buttons and navbars) with a default style. Tailwind gives more design freedom, while Bootstrap is faster for building standard layouts.
	
	- Tailwind uses **responsive design utilities** that are just **shortcuts for CSS media queries**.  
		Instead of writing custom `@media (min-width: ...)` rules, you prepend your utility class with a breakpoint prefix.

- <span style="font-size:16px; color:green;">Bootstrap</span>:
	- A popular CSS framework that provides pre-designed components (like modals, navbars, buttons) and a responsive grid system, making it easy to quickly build clean and functional UIs with minimal custom CSS. Bootstrap follows a mobile-first approach and is ideal for rapid development with a consistent design system.
