### **Chapter 1: Computer System Overview**

#### **Memory Hierarchy**

- **Definition**: A hierarchy of memory types with different trade-offs between speed, capacity, and cost.
    
- **Levels** (from top to bottom):
    
    - Registers
        
    - Cache
        
    - Main Memory (RAM)
        
    - Secondary Memory (e.g., disk)
        
- **Characteristics**:
    
    - Going down the hierarchy: cost per bit decreases, capacity increases, access time increases.
        
    - Principle of Locality: Memory accesses tend to cluster in time and space.
        

#### **Mapping Function**

- Determines where a memory block is placed in the cache.
    
- Types:
    
    - Direct Mapping
        
    - Associative Mapping
        
    - Set-Associative Mapping
        
- Affects cache performance and complexity.
    

#### **Symmetric Multiprocessor (SMP)**

- **Definition**: A system with multiple similar processors sharing the same memory and I/O.
    
- **Characteristics**:
    
    - Two or more processors
        
    - Shared main memory
        
    - Integrated OS controlling all processors
        
- **Advantages**:
    
    - Performance through parallelism
        
    - Incremental growth
        
    - High availability
        

#### **Interrupts and Types**

- **Definition**: A mechanism to interrupt normal processor execution to handle high-priority events.
    
- **Types**:
    
    - **Program**: Caused by instruction execution (e.g., division by zero).
        
    - **Timer**: Generated by an internal timer.
        
    - **I/O**: Generated by I/O devices.
        
    - **Hardware Failure**: Caused by hardware errors (e.g., power failure).

### **Chapter 2: Operating System Overview**

#### **Microkernel Architecture**

- **Definition**: A minimal OS kernel providing only essential services.
    
- **Functions**:
    
    - Address space management
        
    - Interprocess communication (IPC)
        
    - Basic scheduling
        
- **Advantages**:
    
    - Flexibility
        
    - Easier to extend and maintain
        
    - Suitable for distributed systems
        

#### **Symmetric Multiprocessing (SMP)**

- **Definition**: OS support for multiple processors running independently.
    
- **OS Considerations**:
    
    - Simultaneous concurrent processes
        
    - Reentrant kernel routines
        
    - Synchronization and memory management
        
    - Reliability and fault tolerance

### **Chapter 3: Process Description and Control**

#### **Process Models**

- **Two-State Model**: Running and Not Running.
    
- **Five-State Model**: New, Ready, Running, Blocked, Exit.
    
- **Suspended States**: Added to manage memory and process swapping.
    

#### **Process Definitions**

- **Process**: A program in execution with its own address space and resources.
    
- **Process Image**: The collection of data and structures representing a process in memory.
    

#### **Process Control Block (PCB)**

- **Definition**: A data structure containing all information needed to manage a process.
    
- **Elements**:
    
    - Process ID
        
    - Process state
        
    - Program counter
        
    - CPU registers
        
    - Memory management info
        
    - I/O status info
        
    - Accounting info
        

#### **Process Image Components**

- **User Data**: Modifiable user space (variables, data).
    
- **User Program**: The executable code.
    
- **Stack**: Used for function calls, parameters, and local variables.
    
- **Heap**: Dynamically allocated memory.

### **Chapter 4: Threads**

#### **Thread Concepts and Definitions**

- **Thread**: A lightweight unit of execution within a process.
    
- **Process vs. Thread**:
    
    - Process: Resource ownership
        
    - Thread: Unit of scheduling and execution
        

#### **Types of Threads**

- **User-Level Threads (ULT)**:
    
    - Managed in user space.
        
    - Fast creation and switching.
        
    - Disadvantage: Blocking system calls block all threads.
        
- **Kernel-Level Threads (KLT)**:
    
    - Managed by the kernel.
        
    - Can run in parallel on multiple processors.
        
    - Disadvantage: Slower due to kernel involvement.
        
- **Combined Approach**:
    
    - Example: Solaris
        
    - ULTs and KLTs used together for flexibility and performance.
        

#### **Examples**

- **Java Runtime**: One process with multiple threads.
    
- **Windows**: Kernel-level threads.
    
- **Linux**: Uses `clone()` system call; threads are treated as lightweight processes.
