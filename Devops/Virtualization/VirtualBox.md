**Oracle VirtualBox** is a **free and open-source virtualization software** that lets you run one operating system (OS) **inside another OS** as a “virtual machine” (VM).

- **Host OS**: The OS running on your physical computer (e.g., Windows 10).
    
- **Guest OS**: The OS running inside VirtualBox (e.g., Ubuntu Linux).
    

Think of it like having a **computer inside your computer**.

### **Why Use VirtualBox?**

1. **Try other operating systems safely**
    
    - You can test Linux, Windows, or even older versions of Windows without changing your main system.
        
2. **Experiment without risk**
    
    - Mistakes in the virtual machine won’t affect your main OS.
        
3. **Multiple OS on one machine**
    
    - Run Windows, Linux, or macOS on the same computer simultaneously.
        
4. **Development & testing**
    
    - Useful for programmers to test software on different operating systems.


 **VirtualBox is a Type 2 hypervisor** because it runs on top of your existing OS.
