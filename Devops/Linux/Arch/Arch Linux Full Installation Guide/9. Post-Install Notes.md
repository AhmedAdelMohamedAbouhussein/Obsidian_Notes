## ðŸ“˜ Overview
After installation, chroot configuration, bootloader setup, and enabling services, there are **final steps and checks** to ensure your Arch system is stable and ready for daily use.  

This note covers **reboot, verification, optional tweaks, and maintenance tips**.

## ðŸ§  1. Exit Chroot and Unmount Partitions
	
	exit
	umount -R /mnt
	swapoff -a

### Explanation

- `exit` â†’ Leaves the chroot environment.
    
- `umount -R /mnt` â†’ Recursively unmounts all mounted partitions (`root`, `/boot`, `/home`, `/data`).
    
- `swapoff -a` â†’ Deactivates swap to safely unmount swap partitions.
    

> These steps are important to avoid **data corruption** before reboot.

## ðŸ§  2. Reboot into Your New System

`reboot`

### Explanation

- The system will now boot from the installed **GRUB bootloader**.
    
- You will be prompted for the **LUKS passphrase** if using encrypted root.
    
- Graphical login appears if **SDDM** is enabled with a desktop environment.

## ðŸ§  3. Verify System Functionality

### Check mounts and partitions

`lsblk -f`

### Check swap

`swapon --show`

### Check network

`nmcli device status`

### Explanation

- Confirms all partitions and LVM volumes are properly mounted.
    
- Swap is active.
    
- Network interfaces are managed by **NetworkManager**.

## ðŸ§  4. Optional: Update System

`sudo pacman -Syu`

### Explanation

## ðŸ§  5. Additional Tips

- **Backups**: Make backups of `/home` and `/data` partitions regularly.
    
- **User Management**: Avoid using root; use your sudo-enabled user.
    
- **Check Logs**: Use `journalctl -xe` for troubleshooting.
    
- **Install Essentials**: Add commonly used packages (e.g., `git`, `vim`, `docker`, `firefox`) after boot.
    
- **Enable Services**: Verify services like `NetworkManager`, `sddm`, and `bluetooth` are active.

|Issue|Cause|Fix|
|---|---|---|
|System fails to boot|Wrong UUID in `fstab` or `crypttab`|Verify UUIDs with `blkid` and correct files|
