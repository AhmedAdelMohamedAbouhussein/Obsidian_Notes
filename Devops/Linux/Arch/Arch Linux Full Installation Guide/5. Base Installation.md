## ðŸ“˜ Overview
After partitioning, encrypting, and setting up LVM, the next step is **mounting the partitions**.  
Mounting attaches storage devices to the **filesystem tree**, so the installer knows where to copy system files.

---

## ðŸ§  1. Mount the Root Partition

	mount /dev/main_volgroup0/lv_root /mnt

### Explanation

- Mounts the **root logical volume** (`lv_root`) to `/mnt`.
    
- `/mnt` is the **temporary installation root** used during Arch installation.
    
- All subsequent system files (`/boot`, `/home`) will be mounted **inside `/mnt`**.
    

---

## ðŸ§  2. Mount the Boot Partition

`mkdir /mnt/boot mount /dev/sdb2 /mnt/boot`

### Explanation

- `/boot` holds the **kernel, initramfs, and bootloader files**.
    
- A separate `/boot` partition ensures **bootloader independence** and makes kernel upgrades safer.
    

---

## ðŸ§  3. Mount the Home Partition

`mkdir /mnt/home mount /dev/main_volgroup0/lv_home /mnt/home`

### Explanation

- Mounts the **home logical volume** for user data.
    
- Keeps user files separate from system files for easier backups and reinstalls.
    

---

## ðŸ§  4. Mount an Optional Data Partition

`mkdir /mnt/data mount /dev/data_volgroup0/lv_data /mnt/data`

### Explanation

- For setups with an additional **encrypted LVM volume for data**, mount it under `/mnt/data`.
    
- Useful for storing personal files or media separately from the OS.
    

---

## ðŸ§  5. Enable Swap

`swapon /dev/sdb3 swapon --show`

### Explanation

- Activates the **swap partition**, used for virtual memory.
    
- `swapon --show` confirms that swap is active.
    
- Swap is essential for hibernation and to prevent memory exhaustion in low-RAM systems.
    

---

## ðŸ’¡ Notes & Tips

- Always **mount in the correct order**: root â†’ boot â†’ home â†’ other volumes.
    
- Use `lsblk` to verify **mount points**:
    

`lsblk -f`

- Ensure **swap is active** before running `pacstrap`, as some installations may use swap for temporary tasks.
    
- Remember: `/mnt` is **temporary**. After installation, the system will use `/` as the root directory.


## ðŸ“˜ Overview
After mounting your partitions, the next step is installing the **base Arch Linux system** using `pacstrap` and then **chrooting** into it.  
Chroot allows you to operate **inside the new system** as if it were booted, enabling configuration, user creation, and bootloader setup.

---

## ðŸ§  1. Install Base System
	pacstrap -i /mnt base

### Explanation

- Installs the **base system** (minimal Arch Linux) onto `/mnt`.
    
- `-i` â†’ Interactive mode; prompts for confirmation for each package.
    
- `base` â†’ The essential packages: kernel, core utilities, pacman, etc.
    

> Optional: Include `base-devel` if you plan to compile software from source.

---

## ðŸ§  2. Chroot Into the New System

`arch-chroot /mnt`

### Explanation

- **Chroot** stands for **change root**.
    
- Changes your root directory to `/mnt`, effectively entering the new Arch system.
    
- After chroot, any commands you run affect the **newly installed system**, not the live USB.
    

### Example Tasks in Chroot

- Set root password: `passwd`
    
- Create users: `useradd -m -G wheel -s /bin/bash AhmedAdel`
    
- Generate `fstab`: `genfstab -U -p /mnt >> /mnt/etc/fstab`
    
- Configure time, locale, hostname, and install bootloader packages.
    

---

## ðŸ§  3. Optional: Verify Mounts Inside Chroot

`lsblk mount | grep /mnt`

- Ensures that **all partitions are mounted correctly** inside the chroot environment.
    
- Especially important when using **LVM or encrypted volumes**, to confirm they are accessible.
    

---

## ðŸ§  4. Exit Chroot

`exit`

- Leaves the chroot environment and returns to the live USB system.
    
- Useful after configuration or when finalizing installation steps before reboot.
    

---

## ðŸ’¡ Notes & Tips

- Always **chroot after mounting and installing base packages** to configure the system.
    
- Verify that `/etc/fstab` is correct before rebooting; mistakes can prevent the system from booting.
    
- Chroot commands are **executed as root**, so ensure you donâ€™t accidentally overwrite the live system.
