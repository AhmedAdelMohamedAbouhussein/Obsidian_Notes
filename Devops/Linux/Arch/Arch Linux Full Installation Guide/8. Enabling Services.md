## ðŸ“˜ Overview
After installing the system, configuring users, and setting up the bootloader, the next step is to **enable essential services**.  
Services (daemons) run in the background and provide system functionality such as networking, display login, and hardware support.

## ðŸ§  1. Enable NetworkManager

	systemctl enable NetworkManager
	systemctl start NetworkManager

### Explanation

- **NetworkManager** manages network connections (Ethernet, Wi-Fi, VPN).
    
- `enable` â†’ Starts NetworkManager automatically at boot.
    
- `start` â†’ Starts it immediately without reboot.
    

> You can check the status with:

`systemctl status NetworkManager`

## ðŸ§  2. Enable Display Manager (SDDM)

`systemctl enable sddm systemctl start sddm`

### Explanation

- **SDDM** (Simple Desktop Display Manager) provides the graphical login screen for **Plasma Desktop**.
    
- `enable` â†’ Makes it start automatically at boot.
    
- `start` â†’ Launches it immediately.
    

> If you installed a different desktop environment, replace `sddm` with the corresponding display manager (e.g., `gdm`, `lightdm`).

## ðŸ§  3. Enable Bluetooth (Optional)

`systemctl enable bluetooth systemctl start bluetooth`

### Explanation

- Enables **Bluetooth services** for connecting devices like headphones, mice, or keyboards.
    
- Optional but recommended for modern laptops and desktops.

## ðŸ§  4. Enable Swap (Optional if not already active)

`swapon --show`

- Confirms that swap is active.
    
- If swap is not active:
    

`swapon /dev/sdb3`

### Explanation

- Swap provides virtual memory, essential for low-RAM systems or hibernation.

## ðŸ§  5. Check Enabled Services

`systemctl list-unit-files --type=service | grep enabled`

- Lists all **enabled services**.
    
- Helps verify that NetworkManager, SDDM, and other critical services are set to start at boot.

## ðŸ’¡ Notes & Tips

- Always enable **NetworkManager** before reboot to avoid being offline on first boot.
    
- Display managers are required for **graphical desktop environments**; otherwise, you boot into a terminal.
    
- Use `systemctl disable <service>` if you need to stop a service from starting automatically.
    
- For troubleshooting, `journalctl -xe` shows logs of service errors.
