## üìò Overview
LUKS (Linux Unified Key Setup) provides **disk encryption**, securing your data.  
LVM (Logical Volume Manager) allows flexible partitioning within physical volumes.  
Combining **LUKS + LVM** enables encrypted logical volumes with dynamic resizing and better management.

## üß† 1. Encrypt a Partition with LUKS

### Command
	cryptsetup luksFormat /dev/sdb4

### Explanation

- Encrypts the partition `/dev/sdb4` using **LUKS**.
    
- You will be prompted to enter a **passphrase**.
    
- Warning: **All data on this partition will be destroyed**.
    
- LUKS ensures that the data on disk is **inaccessible without the passphrase**.
    

---

### Open the Encrypted Partition

`cryptsetup open --type luks /dev/sdb4 main_lvm`

- Opens the encrypted container and maps it to `/dev/mapper/main_lvm`.
    
- `main_lvm` is the name of the mapper device.
    

> Think of it as ‚Äúunlocking‚Äù the encrypted partition so that LVM can use it.

---

## üß† 2. Create a Physical Volume (PV)

`pvcreate /dev/mapper/main_lvm`

- Initializes the unlocked partition for **LVM**.
    
- A **Physical Volume** is the first layer in LVM.
    

---

## üß† 3. Create a Volume Group (VG)

`vgcreate main_volgroup0 /dev/mapper/main_lvm`

- Groups one or more PVs into a **Volume Group**.
    
- `main_volgroup0` is the name of the volume group.
    

> Think of a VG as a ‚Äúpool of storage‚Äù from which logical volumes (LVs) can be allocated.

---

## üß† 4. Create Logical Volumes (LVs)

### Root Volume

`lvcreate -L 30GB main_volgroup0 -n lv_root`

- Creates a **logical volume** of size 30GB named `lv_root`.
    
- Will be used for `/` (root filesystem).
    

### Home Volume

`lvcreate -l 100%FREE -n lv_home main_volgroup0`

- Allocates **all remaining space** to `lv_home`.
    
- Will be used for `/home`.
    

### Check LVM Setup

`lvdisplay`

- Shows all **logical volumes**, their size, and paths.
    

---

## üß† 5. Optional: Separate Encrypted Volume for Data

- Another disk (`/dev/sda1`) can also be encrypted and used with LVM:
    

`cryptsetup luksFormat /dev/sda1 cryptsetup open --type luks /dev/sda1 data_lvm pvcreate /dev/mapper/data_lvm vgcreate data_volgroup0 /dev/mapper/data_lvm lvcreate -l 100%FREE -n lv_data data_volgroup0 lvdisplay`

- `data_volgroup0` ‚Üí volume group for the encrypted data.
    
- `lv_data` ‚Üí logical volume for storing data files.
    

---

## üß† 6. Load Device Mapper Module

`modprobe dm_mod`

- Ensures **device-mapper kernel module** is loaded.
    
- Required for LVM and encrypted volumes.
    

---

## üß† 7. Scan & Activate LVM Volumes

`vgscan vgchange -ay`

- `vgscan` ‚Üí Detects all volume groups on the system.
    
- `vgchange -ay` ‚Üí Activates all volume groups, making logical volumes available for formatting.
    

---

## üß† 8. Format Logical Volumes

`mkfs.ext4 /dev/main_volgroup0/lv_root mkfs.ext4 /dev/main_volgroup0/lv_home mkfs.ext4 /dev/data_volgroup0/lv_data`

- Formats the logical volumes with **ext4 filesystem**.
    
- Ready to be mounted for installation.
    

---

## üí° Notes & Tips

- Always **backup your encryption passphrase**. Losing it means **all data is unrecoverable**.
    
- LVM allows **resizing volumes** later if needed.
    
- You can combine **multiple encrypted PVs** into a single volume group for more complex setups.
    
- Use `lsblk` or `lvdisplay` frequently to **check that devices are mapped and active**.
