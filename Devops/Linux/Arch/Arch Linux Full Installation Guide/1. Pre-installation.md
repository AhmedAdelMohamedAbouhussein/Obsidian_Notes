ðŸ§  1. Check Network Interfaces

	ip link
	ip addr show

### Explanation

- `ip link` â†’ Lists all network interfaces on your system (Ethernet, Wi-Fi, virtual adapters, etc.).
    
- `ip addr show` â†’ Shows IP addresses assigned to each interface.
    
- This helps you **confirm network connectivity** before starting the installation, especially if you plan to use `pacstrap` to download packages.

ðŸ§  2. Check Services (Optional Pre-installation)

	systemctl status sshd

- Checks the status of the SSH daemon if you plan on **remote installation**.
    
- Not strictly needed for local installs, but useful for headless servers or VMs.

## ðŸ§  3. Verify Storage Devices

`lsblk`

- Lists all block devices (HDDs, SSDs, USB drives) and their partitions.
    
- Provides size, mount points, and hierarchy (helpful before partitioning).

## ðŸ§  4. Disk Partitioning Preparation

`fdisk /dev/sdX`

- `fdisk` is a command-line tool to **create, delete, and manage partitions** on a disk.
    
- Options inside `fdisk`:
    
    - `g` â†’ Create a new GPT partition table.
        
    - `p` â†’ Print the current partition table.
        
    - `n` â†’ Create a new partition.
        
    - `w` â†’ Write changes to disk.

### Example Concept

For this setup, we plan:

- 1 partition for **EFI**
    
- 1 partition for **/boot**
    
- 1 partition for **swap**
    
- The rest for **root and LVM volumes**.

## ðŸ§  5. Key BIOS/UEFI Preparation

- **Secure Boot:** Disable to simplify Arch installation.
    
- **SATA Mode:** Set to **AHCI** for SSD/HDD compatibility.
    
- **Boot Priority:** USB with Arch ISO should be first.
    
- **Fast Boot:** Disable to detect USB drives reliably.
    
- **Virtualization:** Enable VT-x/AMD-V if using Docker, VMs, or WSL2 later.

## ðŸ’¡ Notes & Tips

- Always **backup any important data** before partitioning.
    
- Confirm the correct **disk device name** (`/dev/sda`, `/dev/sdb`) using `lsblk`.
    
- Arch installation **requires a working internet connection** if you want to install packages with `pacstrap`.
