An **ISO file** (or **ISO image**) is a **single file that contains the entire contents of a CD, DVD, or Blu-ray disc** in a standardized format. It’s called an “image” because it’s like a **snapshot of the disc**.

### **Key Points about ISO Files**

1. **Contains all data**
    
    - Includes files, folders, and system information needed for installation.
        
2. **Used for OS installation**
    
    - Most operating systems (like Ubuntu, Windows, or Linux distros) are distributed as ISO files.
        
3. **Can be mounted or burned**
    
    - You can “mount” it in a virtual machine like VirtualBox, making the VM think a real disc is inserted.
        
    - Or you can burn it to a CD/DVD or USB drive to install on a physical machine.
        
4. **File extension**
    
    - Always ends with **.iso**, e.g., `ubuntu-24.04.3-desktop-amd64.iso`.

### **Example**

- Downloading Ubuntu: you get an `ubuntu.iso` file.
    
- In VirtualBox, you **attach this ISO** to your virtual machine.
    
- When the VM starts, it boots from the ISO and runs the installer, just like booting from a real CD.
