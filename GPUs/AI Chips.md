## 1. **Definition**

**AI chips** are **specialized hardware processors** designed specifically to accelerate **artificial intelligence (AI)** and **machine learning (ML)** tasks ‚Äî particularly those involving **neural networks**, **matrix operations**, and **deep learning inference/training**.

üß© They are optimized for:

- **Parallel computation**
    
- **Matrix multiplication**
    
- **Low power consumption**
    
- **High throughput**

## 2. **Why Regular CPUs and GPUs Aren‚Äôt Enough**

- **CPUs** are general-purpose ‚Äî excellent for logic and control but limited in parallel performance.
    
- **GPUs** improved this with thousands of cores for parallel math, but still include unnecessary graphics logic.  
    ‚û°Ô∏è **AI chips** remove all unnecessary components and focus purely on AI workloads.
