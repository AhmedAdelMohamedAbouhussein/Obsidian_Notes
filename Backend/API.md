## What is an API?

**API** stands for **Application Programming Interface**.
It's a **bridge** or **middleman** that allows **two applications to talk to each other**.

## Technical Definition

An API defines **rules for how software can interact**.

For example:

- Your **frontend React app** can use an API to get data from a **backend server**.
- Your app makes an **HTTP request** to the API (like `GET /products`).
- The API responds with **JSON data** (like a list of products).
