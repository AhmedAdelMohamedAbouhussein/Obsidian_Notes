A **Cloudflare Tunnel** (formerly called **Argo Tunnel**) is a service provided by **Cloudflare** that allows you to securely expose a local server or application to the internet without opening ports on your router or firewall. It creates a **secure, outbound-only connection** from your server to Cloudflare’s network, which then makes your service accessible via a public URL.

Here’s the breakdown:

### How it works:

1. **Install Cloudflared**: This is Cloudflare’s lightweight client that runs on your server or local machine.
2. **Run a tunnel**: You tell `cloudflared` which local port your application is running on (like `localhost:8080`).
3. **Secure exposure**: Cloudflare assigns a public URL (like `https://randomname.trycloudflare.com`) and routes traffic through its network to your local service.
4. **No open ports needed**: You don’t need to configure your router or firewall to allow incoming connections — everything goes **outbound** through the tunnel.

### Common Use Cases:

- Testing a local web app without deploying it publicly.
- Exposing development servers (like local websites, APIs) to clients or teammates.
- Accessing internal services remotely without VPNs.
- Creating a secure endpoint for webhooks.


### Example command:

`cloudflared tunnel --url http://localhost:8080`

This will start a tunnel to your local server on port 8080 and give you a public URL to access it.
