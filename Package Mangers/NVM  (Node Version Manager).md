## **1. NVM (Node Version Manager)**

**What it is:**

- NVM is a command-line tool to manage multiple versions of Node.js.
    
- Useful because different projects may require different Node.js versions, and switching versions manually is cumbersome.

**Key features:**

- Install any Node.js version.
    
- Switch between versions instantly.
    
- Set default (global) Node version.
    
- Set a Node version for a specific project (directory-local).
