**Rust** is a **systems programming language** that is designed to be **fast, safe, and concurrent**. It’s often compared to C and C++ because it gives you low-level control over memory and performance but adds strong safety guarantees. Here's a quick overview:

|Feature|Rust|
|---|---|
|**Compilation**|Compiled to machine code, produces executables.|
|**Memory Management**|No garbage collector; uses **ownership, borrowing, and lifetimes** to manage memory safely at compile-time.|
|**Safety**|Prevents common bugs like **null pointer dereference, dangling pointers, data races**, and many memory leaks.|
|**Concurrency**|Safe concurrency built-in; the compiler enforces rules to prevent race conditions.|
|**Use Cases**|Systems programming, game engines, web assembly, embedded devices, performance-critical apps.|
|**Syntax Level**|Low-level like C/C++, but modern and expressive like Swift/Kotlin.|
