In AWS, everything is an API call. An API is an application programming interface that defines predetermined ways for you to interact with AWS services. And you can invoke or call these APIs to provision, configure, and manage your resources.

1. The AWS Management Console is a web interface for managing AWS services, offering quick access to services, search functionality, and simplified workflows. With the mobile app, you monitor resources, view alarms, and check billing, supporting multiple logged-in identities at once.

**Good for**: Users who prefer a visual, easy-to-use interface for managing and configuring AWS services

2. With the AWS CLI, you manage multiple AWS services directly from the command line across Windows, macOS, and Linux. You can automate tasks through scripts, such as launching EC2 instances.

**Good for**: Advanced users and developers who need to automate tasks, script actions, and manage AWS resources efficiently from the command line

We can run commands using AWS CloudShell, which is a cloud-based terminal that has the AWS CLI already installed in a managed environment.

3. The AWS SDK simplifies integrating AWS services into your applications by providing APIs for various programming languages. AWS offers documentation and sample code for languages like C++, Java, and .NET to help you get started.

**Good for**: Developers looking to integrate AWS services into their applications using language-specific APIs
