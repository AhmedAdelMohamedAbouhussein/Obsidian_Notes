### ðŸ”¹ What is a VPS?

A **VPS** is a virtual machine you rent from a hosting provider. It runs its own operating system and has dedicated resources (CPU, RAM, storage) carved out from a physical server. Think of it as a middle ground between **shared hosting** and a **dedicated server**.

### ðŸ”¹ How it works

- A physical server is divided into multiple **virtual servers** using virtualization software (like KVM, VMware, Xen).
    
- Each VPS behaves like a standalone server with its own:
    - Operating system (Linux, Windows, etc.)
    - CPU/RAM allocation
    - Storage and network resources
        
- You get **root/admin access** to configure it however you want.

### ðŸ”¹ Common uses

- Hosting websites (WordPress, e-commerce sites, custom apps).
- Running game servers (Minecraft, Rust, etc.).
- Deploying applications (Node.js, Python, Java).
- Hosting databases (MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB).
- Running VPNs, proxies, or other networking services.
- Experimenting with cloud setups (self-learning alternative to AWS/GCP).

### ðŸ”¹ Pros

- Cheaper than a dedicated server.
- More control and performance than shared hosting.
- Flexible â€” install any software/OS.
- Scalable (can often upgrade CPU, RAM, storage easily).

### ðŸ”¹ Cons

- You manage it yourself (need sysadmin knowledge).
- Not as scalable or integrated as cloud services (AWS EC2, GCP, Azure).
- Performance depends on providerâ€™s hardware and overselling practices.
