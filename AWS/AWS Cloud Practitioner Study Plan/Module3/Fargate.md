AWS Fargate is a serverless compute engine for containers. It works with both Amazon ECS and Amazon EKS.Â Fargate is a container hosting platform, unlike Amazon ECS and Amazon EKS, which are both container orchestration services.

When using Fargate, you do not need to provision or manage servers. Fargate manages your server infrastructure for you. You can focus more on innovating and developing your applications, and you pay only for the resources that are required to run your containers.
