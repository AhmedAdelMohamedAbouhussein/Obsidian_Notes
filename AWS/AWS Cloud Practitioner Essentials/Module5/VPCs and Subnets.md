**Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)** 

An Amazon VPC lets you provision a logically isolated section of the AWS Cloud where you can launch AWS resources in a virtual network that you define .A VPC helps you to control your network resources and security.

In this virtual network, you can launch whatever resources you decide on. More importantly, these resources can be public or private. Public-facing resources have access to the internet, whereas private resources do not have internet access.

**Subnet**

Subnets are used to organize your resources and can be made publicly or privately accessible. A private subnet is commonly used to contain resources like a database storing customer or transactional information. A public subnet is commonly used for resources like a customer-facing website.

**Subnets** are essentially segments of your VPC, allowing you to divide your VPC into smaller, manageable sections. A subnet is a range of IP addresses in your VPC.
