As your cloud infrastructure expands globally, inter-Region peering connects transit gateways together using the AWS Global Infrastructure.

A NAT gateway is a NAT service. You can use a NAT gateway so that instances in a private subnet can connect to services outside your VPC but external services can't initiate a connection with those instances.

The Amazon API Gateway is an AWS service for creating, publishing, maintaining, monitoring, and securing APIs at any scale.
