1. VPN

This setup allows a company to securely connect their on-premises network to their cloud-based resources on AWS. This essentially creates a private, encrypted tunnel to access data and applications in the cloud from their physical office location, while maintaining data security and privacy over the public internet. Companies often use this for remote employees who need to access sensitive information that is stored in the AWS cloud.

while there are definitely benefits to using a VPN to connect to a VPC, and it works great for many customers, it does also have a few potential limitations to be aware of. One thing is that VPN connections do share the bandwidth of the local internet, so the connection can be prone to slowdowns if you have heavy payloads of data being sent over the internet to AWS. Another consideration might be your company requirements to meet certain compliance or regulatory standards. If you're worried about those types of things, then you might consider using Direct Connect.

2. Direct Connect

Traffic will be routed from their corporate data center to a Direct Connect location. It is then routed to a VPC through a virtual private gateway. All network traffic flows through this dedicated private connection. This helps to speed up data transfers, address application performance and increase a company's data transfer security.
