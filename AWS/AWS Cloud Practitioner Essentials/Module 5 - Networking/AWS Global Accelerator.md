Global Accelerator is a service that uses the AWS global network to improve application availability, performance, and security. It uses intelligent traffic routing and fast failover if something goes wrong in one of your application locations.

Global Accelerator is a networking service that helps your applications run faster and more reliably across the globe. Think of it like creating express lanes on the internet highway specifically for your application's traffic. Instead of your users' requests taking the regular, sometimes congested internet routes, Global Accelerator directs traffic through the AWS private global network—getting your users to your application faster and more reliably.
