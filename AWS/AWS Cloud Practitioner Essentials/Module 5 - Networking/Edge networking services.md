Edge networkingÂ is the process of bringing information storage and computing abilities closer to the devices that produce that information and the users who consume it. Edge computing is important because organizations often need lower latency access to their data and content. By performing tasks or caching data locally or closer to users, organizations can deliver faster, more responsive experiences while maintaining better control over their infrastructure. There are also many different services that are hosted on the edge, like the DNS service, Amazon Route 53.
