✅ **Exam Tips**

- _Cloud Computing_ → Pay only for what you use, scale up/down on demand.
    
- _Shared Responsibility Model_ → AWS = **Security of the cloud**, Customer = **Security in the cloud**.
    
- _Regions vs AZs_ → AZs provide redundancy inside Regions; use **multi-AZ** for high availability.
