### AI
Artificial Intelligence is a broad field focused on the development of intelligent computer systems capable of performing humanlike tasks.

### ML
Machine learning is a type of AI for training machines to perform complex tasks without explicit instructions. Machine learning training finds the patterns hidden in vast amounts of historical data to produce an ML model. This ML model can then be applied to new data to make predictions or decisions based on the patterns it's learned.
**Types of ML**:

- **Supervised Learning** → Learn from labeled data (e.g., spam vs. not spam).

- **Unsupervised Learning** → Find hidden patterns in unlabeled data (e.g., customer segmentation).

- **Reinforcement Learning** → Learn by trial and error with rewards (e.g., training a game-playing AI).
## NLP (Natural Language Processing)
A **subfield of AI and ML** focused on enabling machines to understand, interpret, and generate human language.


✅ **Relationship**:

- **AI** is the big umbrella.
- **ML** is one way to achieve AI.
- **NLP** is a specialized branch of AI (often powered by ML) that deals with human language.

### Deep learning

Deep learning (DL) is a subset of machine learning where models are trained using layers of artificial neurons that mimic the human brain. Each layer of these neural networks summarizes and feeds information to the next layer until a final model is produced.

### Generative AI

Generative AI is a type of deep learning powered by extremely large ML models known as foundation models (FMs). FMs are pre-trained on vast collections of data. While traditional ML models are trained to perform singular tasks, FMs can be adapted to perform multiple tasks.

Large language models (LLMs), are a popular type of FM trained to use human language. Foundation models can also be used to create videos, images, music, and more.


## FMS (Foundation Models)

Large-scale AI models trained on massive, broad datasets that can be adapted (fine-tuned) for many downstream tasks.
**Why they matter**: Instead of building a model from scratch, you start with a foundation model and specialize it.


## LLMs (Large Language Models)

A **type of foundation model** trained specifically on massive amounts of **text data** to understand and generate human language.
