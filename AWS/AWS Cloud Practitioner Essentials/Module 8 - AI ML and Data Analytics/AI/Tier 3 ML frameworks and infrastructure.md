Some organizations have highly specialized needs that require complete control over the ML training process. They can use in-house expertise, ML frameworks, and AWS infrastructure to develop their own ML solutions.


Core components


> **ML frameworks**

An ML framework is a software library or tool that provides experienced ML practitioners with pre-built, optimized components for building machine learning models. AWS supports ML frameworks like PyTorch, Apache M-X Net, and TensorFlow.


> **AWS ML infrastructure**

AWS ML infrastructure, such as ML-optimized Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instances, Amazon EMR, and Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS), can support these custom solutions. These services provide high performance and flexibility for advanced ML workloads.
