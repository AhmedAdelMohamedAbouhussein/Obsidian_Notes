**Edge locations**

AWS has smaller footprint facilities called edge locations. Edge locations cache items like images, videos, and other resources, so that users can access the content they need with lower latency. 
AWS has a global edge network that provides quicker content access to users outside of standard Regions. These edge locations are strategically placed in areas like Atlanta, Georgia, USA or Shanghai, China to provide low-latency access to AWS services and content delivery. Edge locations offer multiple services to run closer to end users, including AWS networking services like Amazon CloudFront. CloudFront is a content delivery network (CDN) and caching system that you learn more about later in this training.


**CloudFormation**

AWS has services, such as CloudFormation, that you can use to help automate the deployment of your cloud resources. These services use infrastructure as code, or IaC, helping you achieve a consistent, reliable set up each time your business grows.

CloudFormation helps you model and set up your AWS resources so that you can spend less time managing those resources and more time focusing on your applications that run in AWS. With CloudFormation, you can define your infrastructure as code. You create a template that describes all the AWS resources that you want (like Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instances), and CloudFormation takes care of provisioning and configuring those resources for you.
