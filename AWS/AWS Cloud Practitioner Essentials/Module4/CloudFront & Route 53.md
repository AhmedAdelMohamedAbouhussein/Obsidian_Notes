CloudFront is a content delivery network, and it’s designed to serve content as close to users as possible. This content can be images, data, videos, applications, APIs, etc..

CloudFront uses Edge locations, which are part of our worldwide Amazon Global Edge Network. These edge locations are actually separate from Regions and are specifically designed to accelerate content delivery. 

Edge locations host other AWS services, like AWS Global Accelerator and Amazon Route 53. 

Route 53 is a Domain Name System, or DNS, that routes end users to internet applications. Essentially, it converts human-readable URLs to machine-readable IP addresses. ‘Cause trust me, you don’t want to have to remember IP addresses by heart.
