**Compliance**

Compliance is an important consideration when selecting Regions for deploying business resources. Different geographical locations have varying regulatory requirements and data protection laws that organizations must follow. For example, the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is designed to protect the personal data and privacy of individuals within the European Union (EU). An online retail company operating in the EU would be required to meet GDPR compliance to protect customer data. GDPR compliance includes obtaining proper consent for data collection and providing mechanisms for data access and deletion.


**Proximity**

When selecting a Region, you also want to consider how to achieve low latency for your users. Regions closer to your user base minimize data travel time, which reduces latency and enhances application responsiveness. Choosing a Region or set of Regions farther away from customers could introduce delays, which might impact user satisfaction and overall system efficiency.


**Feature availability**

You also want to consider which specific features and services are available in each Region. AWS is constantly expanding features and services to multiple locations, but not all Regions contain all AWS offerings. For example, AWS GovCloud Regions are specifically designed to meet the compliance and security requirements of US government agencies and their contractors. These Regions have stringent physical, operational, and personnel security controls in place. These controls are only available in specific Regions to meet certain governmental regulatory requirements.


**Pricing**

When selecting a Region, pricing is also a factor that can influence your decision. Some Regions have lower operational costs than others. These operational costs can impact the overall expenses for hosting applications and services. Tax laws and regulations can also play a role in cost. Some Regions might offer tax incentives or have lower tax rates, which can affect customer pricing. Additionally, data sovereignty laws in certain Regions might require data to be stored locally, affecting both compliance and cost.
