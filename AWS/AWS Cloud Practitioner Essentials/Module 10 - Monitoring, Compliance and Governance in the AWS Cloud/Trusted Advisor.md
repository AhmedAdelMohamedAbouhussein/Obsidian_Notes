> **Trusted Advisor**

Optimizing large scale cloud deployments is extremely important to do, and it's not a one-time thing. You must look for ways to optimize for costs, performance, security, and resilience. With AWS Trusted Advisor, you can continuously evaluate your AWS environment by using best practice checks across several categories. All AWS Support plans include access to dozens of Trusted Advisor checks. With Business Support and other advanced plans, you can benefit from hundreds of checks.

**Benefits:** Trusted Advisor helps you align with AWS best practices, prioritize recommendations, and optimize your AWS resources at scale.

**Use cases:** It can be used to optimize cost, efficiency, security, improve performance, and track service limits.

Although Trusted Advisor does check to optimize security, you might need help to check the fine-grained permissions of your AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM). IAM Access Analyzer can help meet your goals for least privilege access within your AWS environment.

IAM Access Analyzer provides capabilities to set, verify, and refine permissions by analyzing external access and validating that your policies match your corporate security standards.

**Benefits:** IAM Access Analyzer provides benefits like refining permissions, validating IAM policies, helping you meet your least privilege goals, and automating IAM policy reviews.

**Use cases:** It can be used to set fine-grained permissions, verify who can access what, remediate unused access, and refine and remove broad access.
