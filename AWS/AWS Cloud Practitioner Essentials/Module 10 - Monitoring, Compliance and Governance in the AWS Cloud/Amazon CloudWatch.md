CloudWatch monitors your AWS resources and the applications that you run on AWS in real time. With CloudWatch, you gain system-wide visibility into resource utilization, application performance, and operational health.  CloudWatch does more than just monitor. It has several features that work together:

- CloudWatch metrics
	    CloudWatch collects metrics from all your AWS resources, applications, and services that run on AWS and on-premises servers.
	    
- CloudWatch alarms
	    With CloudWatch alarms, you can define thresholds on CloudWatch metrics and send notifications or automatically make changes to the resources.
	    
- CloudWatch dashboards
	    Dashboards are customizable home pages in the CloudWatch console that you can use to monitor your resources in a single view.
	    
- CloudWatch logs
		CloudWatch Logs centralize the logs from all of the systems, applications, and AWS services that you use.

**Benefits:** CloudWatch helps you visualize and analyze your resources, operate efficiently with automation, use an integrated view, proactively monitor, and gain insights.
	
**Use case:** It can be used to monitor and troubleshoot infrastructure.
