2. Data storage services

Data can come from many different sources. To gain insights, data is commonly consolidated into a single location. There are two storage options for this. _Flexible data lakes_ store vast amounts of raw data. Alternatively, the more structured _data warehouses_ are optimized for business intelligence.

> **Amazon S3**

Amazon S3 is a popular choice for data lakes. This object storage service can securely house virtually any amount of structured or unstructured data. Amazon S3 is also fully elastic, automatically scaling as you add and remove data.

> **Amazon Redshift**

Amazon Redshift is a fully managed data warehouse service that can store petabytes of structured or semistructured data. With the scalability and pay-as-you-go pricing model, organizations can cost-effectively analyze large datasets.


3. Data cataloging services

Cataloging your data with metadata provides an inventory of your organization's data.

> **AWS Glue Data Catalog**

AWS Glue Data Catalog provides a centralized, scalable, and managed metadata repository that enhances data discovery. It improves the overall efficiency of data pipelines by delivering metadata to various data stores and analytics services.


4. Data processing services

Data processing services clean and transform your data so it's ready to be analyzed.

> **AWS Glue**

AWS Glue is a fully managed ETL service that makes data preparation simpler, faster, and cost effective. AWS Glue ETL jobs can use the AWS Glue Data Catalog to access metadata about data sources, which can help inform transformations defined in the ETL script.
