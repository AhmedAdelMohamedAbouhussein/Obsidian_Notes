In-memory caches

An in-memory cache is a high-speed storage layer that _temporarily stores frequently accessed data in_ a computer's main memory, or _RAM_. Retrieving data from RAM provides extremely fast processing and retrieval speeds, often hundreds or thousands of times faster than traditional disk-based storage systems.

When applications need specific information, they first check the cache before requesting it from the original data source. This reduces the load on primary databases and speeds up response times for end users. In-memory caches are ideal for storing session data, API responses, database query results, and other information that applications require repeatedly.

Amazon ElastiCache

ElastiCache is a fully managed in-memory caching service that was built to help reduce the complexity of administering in-memory caching systems. This means that you can continue to use the same Redis, Valkey, or Memcached tools and configurations to scale your workloads. It automatically detects and replaces failed nodes, which makes it ideal for applications that need consistent high performance.
ElastiCache addresses performance bottlenecks by caching frequently accessed data in memory, to reduce the load on primary databases and improve response times.
### Use cases

Some examples of practical use cases for ElastiCache are session data management, database query enhancement, and gaming leaderboards.
