AWS Backup streamlines data protection across various AWS resources and on-premises deployments by providing a single dashboard for monitoring and managing backups. It eliminates the complexity of managing multiple backup strategies by supporting multiple storage types, including Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) volumes, Amazon Elastic File System (Amazon EFS) file systems, and various databases.

AWS Backup centralizes and automates data protection processes, improving consistency and reducing administrative overhead. It offers flexible scheduling options, encryption capabilities, and cross-Region backup support for enhanced disaster recovery.

### Use cases

Some examples of practical use cases for AWS Backup are centralized disaster recovery, consistent backup policies for compliance requirements, and consolidating multiple backup processes through a single interface.
