**Amazon Managed Blockchain (AMB)** is a **fully managed service** from AWS that makes it easy to build, manage, and scale blockchain networks without needing to set up your own infrastructure.

Instead of manually configuring nodes, managing certificates, and ensuring scalability, AWS handles all the heavy lifting. You just focus on building **decentralized applications (dApps)** or integrating blockchain into your systems.
