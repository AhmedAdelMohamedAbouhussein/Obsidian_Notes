Compute refers to the processing power needed to run applications, manage data, and perform calculations. In the cloud, this power is available on-demand. You can access it remotely without owning or maintaining physical hardware. Essentially, _compute in the cloud_ means creating virtual machines with a cloud provider to run applications and tasks over the internet.  Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2), a powerful compute service from AWS, as you explore its flexibility, cost-effectiveness, and scalability.

Multitenancy :  Sharing underlying hardware between Virtual Machines

hypervisor:  a software responsible for sharing and isolation resources
in Ec2 AWS manages the hypervisor 

EC2 servers are resizable you can give it more memory and more CPU power this is what we call **Vertical Scaling**
in Ec2 you control the Networking aspect of Amazon EC2
