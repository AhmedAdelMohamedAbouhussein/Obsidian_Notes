**Add additional instances.** As mentioned, for the application to work in an active-active system, it’s already created as stateless, not storing any client sessions on the server. This means that having two or four servers wouldn’t require any application changes. It would only be a matter of creating more instances when required and shutting them down when traffic decreases. The Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling service can take care of that task by automatically creating and removing EC2 instances based on metrics from Amazon CloudWatch. We will learn more about this service in this lesson.  
  
You can see that there are many more advantages to using an active-active system in comparison with an active-passive system. Modifying your application to become stateless provides scalability.
