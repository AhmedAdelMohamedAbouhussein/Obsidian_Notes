 compute service designed for heavy-duty tasks like processing massive datasets, running simulations, or performing complex calculations. AWS Batch takes care of the infrastructure management for you. You won’t need to worry about provisioning servers, scaling resources, or managing infrastructure. AWS Batch handles all of that, allowing you to focus on the important tasks like building your application or running your analysis. The service also scales automatically, distributing tasks across a fleet of compute resources like EC2 instances.
 
 AWS Batch is a fully managed service that you can use to run batch computing workloads on AWS. It automatically schedules, manages, and scales compute resources for batch jobs, optimizing resource allocation based on job requirements.
 
 **Good for**: Processing large-scale, parallel workloads in areas like scientific computing, financial risk analysis, media transcoding, big data processing, machine learning training, and genomics research

Ex: 
A pharmaceutical research company needs to run thousands of simulations to analyze protein folding. These compute-heavy tasks are run in parallel and do not require real-time interaction. The company wants the jobs to be automatically scheduled and scaled based on computing demand.
