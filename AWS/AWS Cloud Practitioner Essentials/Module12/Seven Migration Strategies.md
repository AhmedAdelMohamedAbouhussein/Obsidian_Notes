**The most common paths to the cloud**

When customers are migrating applications to the cloud, they can use seven common migration strategies. The decision on which strategy depends on factors such as the complexity of existing applications, business goals, time constraints, and available resources. Often, organizations will use a combination of these strategies across their application portfolio. By carefully considering each option and aligning it with specific applications and objectives, organizations can create a tailored migration plan that maximizes the benefits of cloud adoption while minimizing risks and disruptions.

To learn more about the migration strategies, choose each of the seven markers.

1.  Relocate

Relocating is changing the hosting location to the cloud. This could be if applications are already virtual machines (VMs) or containers running on premises and then moving to the cloud.

2.  Rehost

Rehosting, also known as lift-and-shift, involves moving applications without changes.

In a scenario of a large legacy migration, in which the company is looking to implement its migration and scale quickly to meet a business case, the majority of applications are rehosted.

3.  Replatform

Replatforming, also known as lift, tinker, and shift, involves making a few cloud optimizations to realize a tangible benefit. Optimization is achieved without changing the core architecture of the application.

4. Refactor

Refactoring, also known as re-architecting, involves reimagining how an application is architected and developed by using features built for the cloud. Refactoring is driven by a strong business need to add features, scale, or improve performance that would otherwise be difficult to achieve in the application’s existing environment.

5. Repurchase

Repurchasing involves moving from a traditional license to a software-as-a-service (SaaS) model.

For example, a business might choose to implement the repurchasing strategy by migrating from a customer relationship management (CRM) system to a new sales force software.

6.  Retain

Retaining consists of keeping applications that are critical for the business in the source environment. This might include applications that require major refactoring before they can be migrated or work that can be postponed until a later time.

7. Retire

Retiring is the process of removing applications that are no longer needed.
