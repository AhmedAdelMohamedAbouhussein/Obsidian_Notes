AWS helps guide companies through the migration process, which can be divided into three sequential phases. From the first phase to the last, there are AWS services and tools to support your migration. Although this is not an exhaustive list of every AWS migration service, these core migration services will help get you on your way.

## Assess

In this phase, you build the business case for the migration and assess your readiness. One of the services used in this phase is the Migration Evaluator.

## Mobilize

In this phase, you prepare the organization and mobilize the resources needed for the migration. Two services you might use in this phase are AWS Application Discovery Service and the AWS Migration Hub.

## Migrate and modernize

In this phase, you use your strategy, plan, and the best practices to migrate and modernize. Tools to support you include AWS Application Migration Service and AWS Database Migration Service (AWS DMS). If you are transferring data, you might use AWS DataSync, AWS Transfer Family, and the AWS Snow Family.

## Migration Hub ##

While AWS Migration Hub helps you mobilize your resources, you can use it as a one-stop place to also manage during the migrate and modernize phase. You will learn more about Migration Hub and the other migration services in the next lesson.
