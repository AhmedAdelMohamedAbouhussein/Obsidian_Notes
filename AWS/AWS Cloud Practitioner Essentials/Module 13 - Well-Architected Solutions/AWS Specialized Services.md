Types of services

AWS services are purpose-built for specific use cases. In the following section, you will learn more about the following four types of specialized AWS services:

- Development services
    
- Business application services
    
- End-user computing services
    
- IoT services
    


Development services

AWS offers several services to help developers automate CI/CD pipelines, monitor and debug applications, build GraphQL APIs, and deploy web and mobile applications on AWS. Let's examine these services in a bit more detail.


> **AWS CodeBuild**

CodeBuild is a fully managed continuous integration service that compiles source code, runs tests, and produces software packages for deployment. It automatically scales to meet demand, and you only pay for the build time that you use.


> **AWS CodePipeline**

CodePipeline is a fully managed CI/CD service that automates the build, test, and deploy phases of your release process. This helps developers streamline software release workflows and reliably deliver new features and fixes without needing to provision servers.

> **_CI/CD pipelines_** _automate the integration, testing, and deployment of code changes to help provide quick and reliable software delivery._


> **AWS X-Ray**

X-Ray is a powerful tracing, debugging, and performance analysis tool that helps developers visualize application behavior. With X-Ray, developers can quickly identify performance bottlenecks, troubleshoot issues, and optimize applications for better efficiency and reliability.


> **AWS AppSync**

AWS AppSync is a fully managed GraphQL service. With AWS AppSync, developers can create a single GraphQL API that can securely access, manipulate, and combine data from multiple data sources. This helps developers connect frontend applications with backend data.

> _With_ **_GraphQL_**_, a query language for APIs, clients request only the specific data they need._


> **AWS Amplify**

Amplify helps you streamline the process of developing, deploying, and managing secure and scalable full-stack applications on AWS. With Amplify, developers can quickly add features, like authentication, APIs, storage, and hosting, with minimal infrastructure management.

> **_Full-stack applications_** _are software systems that involve both frontend (user interface) and backend (server-side) development._



Business application services

These services are ideal for managing business application needs such as customer service operations and email promotions. Let's review a couple of examples.


> **Amazon Connect**

Businesses can use this AI-powered contact center service to efficiently set up and operate a scalable customer service call center. Amazon Connect provides capabilities for call routing, recording, and analytics while integrating seamlessly with other AWS services.


> **Amazon Simple Email Service (Amazon SES)**

Amazon SES is a scalable and cost-effective email service provider that can be integrated into any application for reliable, high-volume email automation. It helps businesses optimize the delivery of transactional and marketing emails, resulting in enhanced customer engagement.



End-user computing services

In modern businesses, IT departments often need to provide remote access to resources like virtual desktops and applications. Let's explore some AWS services that can be used to set up these environments for employees.


> **Amazon AppStream 2.0**

AppStream 2.0 is a fully managed service that streams applications from the cloud directly to any compatible device. This includes software-as-a-service (SaaS) applications and applications converted from desktop to SaaS without code revisions. This provides instant access to powerful software without the need for high-end local hardware.

> _In_ **_SaaS_**_,_ _applications are hosted on the cloud and accessed through the internet, without the need for local installation or maintenance._


> **Amazon WorkSpaces**

WorkSpaces is a fully managed cloud-based desktop computing service. With WorkSpaces, employees can securely access their work environment from any device with an internet connection. Employees can perform the same tasks as if they were on a physical office computer, while companies can benefit from cost-efficiency and easy administration.


> **Amazon WorkSpaces Secure Browser (formerly Amazon WorkSpaces Web)**

WorkSpaces Secure Browser is a fully managed remote enterprise browser. It provides a protected environment for employees to access private websites, SaaS applications, and the public internet. With WorkSpaces Secure Browser, IT departments don't need to manage specialized client software, infrastructure, or VPN connections.



IoT services

Internet of Things (IoT) is a network of connected physical devices embedded with sensors and software that collect and exchange data over the internet. These devices can be monitored and controlled remotely to improve efficiency, provide new services, and enhance quality of life.

Let's explore an AWS service specifically designed for IoT management.


> **AWS IoT Core**

AWS IoT Core is a managed cloud service used to securely connect physical devices with cloud applications. It helps you create efficient IoT solutions by streamlining the complex process of ingesting, processing, and acting on device data. Device connections and data are secured with mutual authentication and end-to-end encryption, and you can choose from several communication protocols.

Some IoT solutions include the following:

- **Smart security cameras** – Home monitoring that sends alerts to your phone
    
- **Smart pet feeders** – A pet feeder that you can control remotely
    
- **Smart irrigation systems** – A rain machine that adjusts watering based on weather and soil conditions
