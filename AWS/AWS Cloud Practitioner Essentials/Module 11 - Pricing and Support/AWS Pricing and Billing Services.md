You learned about various AWS pricing and billing services and tools. These services are purpose-built to help you forecast, track, manage, and view your AWS costs. When you are first starting out with the AWS Cloud, they can be hard to tell apart. To help you differentiate the services, let's review these services and their key uses cases.
