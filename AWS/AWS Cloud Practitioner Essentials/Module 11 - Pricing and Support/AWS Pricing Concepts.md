The pricing of AWS services varies based on several factors, such as service category or type, configuration, AWS Region, and which pricing model you choose. Refer to the pricing tab on a service's webpage for details on its specific pricing factors. 

There are three fundamental drivers of cost with AWS: compute, storage, and outbound data transfer. These driving factors impact AWS service categories in different ways. To learn how compute, storage, and outbound data transfer drive cost at AWS, expand each of the following factors.


Compute

For compute resources, you pay by a certain span of time, like by the hour or by the second. Unless you've made a reservation for which the cost is agreed upon beforehand, you pay from the time you launch a resource until the time you stop the instance.


Storage

You can choose from a broad portfolio of storage solutions with deep functionality for storing, accessing, protecting, and analyzing data. Pricing for storage largely depends on how much storage you have provisioned or how much you are using.

For some storage options, such as Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3), storage cost is tiered. This means you can optimize storage costs based on how frequently and quickly you need to access data. With Amazon S3, consider the following six cost components when storing and managing customer data:

- Storage pricing
    
- Request and data retrieval pricing
    
- Data transfer and transfer acceleration pricing
    
- Data management and analytics pricing
    
- Replication pricing
    
- The price to process your data with Amazon S3 Object Lambda
    

To learn more about Amazon S3 pricing, choose the following link and navigate through the pricing tabs: [Amazon S3 Pricing(opens in a new tab)](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/pricing/?nc=sn&loc=4).

 
Data transfer

In most cases, there is no charge for inbound data transfer or for data transfer between AWS services within the same Region. There are some exceptions, so be sure to verify data transfer rates before beginning. 

**Outbound data transfer** is aggregated across services and then charged at the outbound data transfer rate. The more data you transfer, the less you pay per gigabyte. For data storage and transfer, you typically pay per gigabyte.
