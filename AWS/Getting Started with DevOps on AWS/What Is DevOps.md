DevOps is the combination of cultural philosophies, practices, and tools that increases an organization’s ability to deliver applications and services at high velocity: evolving and improving products at a faster pace than organizations using traditional software development and infrastructure management processes. This speed enables organizations to better serve their customers and compete more effectively in the market. 

DevOps emphasizes better collaboration and efficiencies so teams can innovate faster and deliver higher value to businesses and customers.
