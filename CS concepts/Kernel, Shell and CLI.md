### 🧠 **Kernel**

- The **core part** of an operating system.
    
- It manages:
    
    - CPU (processor)
        
    - Memory (RAM)
        
    - Devices (keyboard, disk, etc.)
        
    - System calls (requests from programs)
        

It acts as a **bridge between hardware and software**.  
You never talk to the kernel directly — programs do it for you.

#### 🧩 Example:

When you type `ls` in Linux:

1. `ls` is a **program**.
    
2. It asks the **kernel** to read data from the disk.
    
3. The kernel talks to the **hardware** and returns the result.

### 💬 **Shell**

- The **interface** between the user and the kernel.
    
- It lets you **communicate** with the OS — usually through **commands**.
    
- The shell takes your commands, sends them to the kernel, and shows the output.
    

#### 🖥️ Example shells:

- Bash (Linux)
    
- Zsh (Mac)
    
- PowerShell (Windows)
    
- Fish, Dash, etc.

### 💻 **CLI (Command-Line Interface)**

- The **text-based environment** where you **interact with the shell**.
    
- It displays a **prompt** where you type commands.
    
- The CLI sends those commands to the **shell**, which passes them to the **kernel**.
    
- Commonly used in terminals.
    

#### 🖱️ Example CLIs:

- Terminal (Linux / macOS)
    
- Command Prompt (Windows)
    
- PowerShell Terminal
    
- GNOME Terminal, Konsole, xterm, etc.

### ⚙️ **In short**

|Component|Role|Who interacts with it|Example|
|---|---|---|---|
|**Kernel**|Core of OS, manages hardware & system resources|Programs / Shell|Linux kernel, Windows NT kernel|
|**Shell**|Command interpreter that talks to the kernel|You (through CLI)|Bash, PowerShell, Zsh|
|**CLI**|Text-based interface to use the shell|You (the user)|Terminal, Command Prompt|

### 🧭 **Visual Summary**

`You  →  CLI  →  Shell  →  Kernel  →  Hardware`

### 💡 **Analogy**

Think of a **restaurant**:

- 👤 **User** = You (give the order)
    
- 💻 **CLI** = The menu and order pad (how you communicate)
    
- 🧑‍💼 **Shell** = Waiter (takes your order and passes it on)
    
- 🧑‍🍳 **Kernel** = Chef (does the real work in the kitchen)
    
- 🍽️ **Hardware** = Kitchen tools (oven, stove, etc.)
