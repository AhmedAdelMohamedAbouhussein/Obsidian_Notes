|Performance|Fast, lightweight|Slower, heavier|

- `htop` → process manager
- `midnight commander` → file manager
- `git` CLI interactive tools

## 4. Modern TUI

- Libraries/frameworks exist for creating TUIs:
    
    - **Python:** `urwid`, `rich`, `textual`
        
    - **Rust:** `tui-rs`
        
    - **C++:** `ncurses`
        
- Some TUIs try to mimic GUI features (windows, panels) in text.
