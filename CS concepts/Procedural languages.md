✅ **Procedural Languages :**

- A **type of imperative programming** where code is organized into **procedures (functions)**.
- Focuses on **step-by-step instructions** to tell the computer _how_ to do something.
- Each procedure performs a specific task and can be reused.

---

### 💡 **Key Points**

- Based on **functions / procedures**.
- Uses **variables, loops, conditionals**.
- Executes instructions **in order** (top to bottom).
- Encourages **code reuse** through functions.

### 🧩 **Examples**

- C    
- Pascal
- Fortran
- BASIC
- Python (can be used procedurally)

### ⚙️ **Structure Example (C-like)**

void greet() 
{     
	printf("Hello!"); 
} 
int main()
{     
	greet();     
	return 0; 
}`

### 🧠 **In short:**

> Procedural programming = **“Do this, then this, then that.”**  
> Organized into **procedures/functions** for clarity and reuse.
