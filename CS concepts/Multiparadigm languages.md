A **multiparadigm language** is a programming language that supports **more than one programming paradigm** — meaning it allows developers to use different styles or approaches to solve problems, depending on what fits best. Instead of forcing programmers to stick to just one way of thinking, such as purely object-oriented or purely functional, multiparadigm languages combine features from several paradigms to offer flexibility and power.

For example, a multiparadigm language might let you use **procedural programming** for simple tasks, **object-oriented programming** for structuring larger systems, and **functional programming** for handling data transformations or parallel tasks. This makes it easier to write code that’s both efficient and easy to maintain, while also adapting to different problem types.

Some popular multiparadigm languages include:

- **Python** – supports object-oriented, procedural, and functional programming.
    
- **C++** – supports procedural, object-oriented, and generic programming.
    
- **JavaScript** – supports object-oriented, functional, and event-driven programming.
    
- **C#** – supports object-oriented, functional, and component-oriented programming.
    

In summary, multiparadigm languages give programmers the **freedom to mix and match techniques** from different paradigms, leading to more expressive, adaptable, and modern code.
